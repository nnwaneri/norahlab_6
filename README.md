In this activity we will be focusing on applying the greedy programming strategy to solve a very applied problem: optimizing text layout.

Question:
 Explain why a greedy strategy might be appropriate for this problem of finding a text layout with the minimum number of lines.
 
Answer:
 The greedy strategy is appropriate for this problem because it wraps the text by continuing the text on a new line when the line is full, so that each line fits in a viewable window. This strategy allows the text to read from top to bottom without scrolling horizontally. It breaks the lines between words rather than within words, when possible.
